# techdegree-project-5-portfolio-with-sqlalchemy

This web application is for a professional project portfolio. The main (index) page lists your projects including the project title and short description. Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description.

The application lets the user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS for this site was supplied by TeamTreeHouse development team.
